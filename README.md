# The fastai book
> How to get started with the fastai book.


This information is for readers of the Early Access version of [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) and of the fastai [draft notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).

Note that these require you to use fastai v2, which is currently in pre-release. During pre-release, this module is called `fastai2`. The draft notebooks contain the correct imports for `fastai2`, but the PDF book does not - it uses `fastai`. Therefore, you should change `fastai` to `fastai2` in all import statements.

## Install

Clone the [draft notebooks repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook), and then from that directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

It is best to first install fastai v1 to ensure you have all the correct dependencies. See [the docs](https://docs.fast.ai/) for details.

## How to use

To get started, run Jupyter Notebook (or use one of the online Jupyter platforms listed at https://course.fast.ai) and click on the *app_jupyter.ipynb* notebook.

We'll be adding more information to this site as the official book release in July 2020 gets closer.
